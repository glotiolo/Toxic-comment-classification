# Toxic Comment Classification


This repository contains four machine learning models. The algorithms are trained on the [Jigsaw/Googleâ€™s Toxic Comment Classification Challenge on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data) for toxicity detection in texts. We consolidate the data into two classes: ***toixic and non-toxic***. The implemented models are: Logistic Regression, Naive bayes, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
